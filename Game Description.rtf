\f0\fs24 \cf0 Players compete in one-on-one matches against a series of computer-controlled opponents or against another player. Each match consists of his 3 rounds and the player must knock out his opponent within 30 seconds of him. If a fighter ends the match before he is KO'd, the fighter with the most energy remaining wins the round. To defeat his opponent and advance to the next battle, the player must win two rounds. If the third round ends in a draw, the computer-controlled opponent automatically wins or both players lose. Single player mode allows the loser to continue playing against the same opponent. Similarly, a second player can interrupt his one player match and challenge the first player to a new match.}
